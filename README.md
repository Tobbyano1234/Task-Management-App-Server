# Project: Task Management Web Application

Project Description
Develop a task management web application where users can create, update, and manage tasks. The application will have both frontend and backend components. Users should be able to register, log in, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. The application should be responsive and user-friendly.

Frontend Requirements

1. User registration and login pages.
2. Dashboard displaying a list of tasks for the logged-in user.
3. Task creation, editing, and deletion functionality.
4. Filter and sorting options for tasks.
5. User-friendly interface with responsive design.
6. Use of modern frontend technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and a frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js.

Backend Requirements

1. RESTful API to handle user authentication (registration and login).
2. API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks.
3. Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
4. Database schema and design to store user information and tasks.
5. Backend logic to handle task filtering and sorting.
6. Use of a backend framework such as Express (Node.js), Django (Python), or Ruby on Rails (Ruby).

Bonus Challenges

1. Implement user roles (admin and regular user) with different permissions.
2. Add due dates and notifications for tasks.
3. Use state management in the frontend (e.g., Redux) for a more organized UI.
4. Implement real-time updates using WebSockets.
